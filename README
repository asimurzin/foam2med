Introduction
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a command line utility that allows to translate OpenFOAM 
( Open Source CFD Toolbox, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/foam/ )
data into MED format ( see http://www.code-aster.org/outils/med/ ). 
The initial goal to develop this utility was to be able integrate 
OpenFOAM functionality with SALOME ( see http://www.salome-platform.org ).

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the INSTALL file for more information about installing of foam2med 
utility.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"foam2med" utility requires OpenFOAM and SALOME as its pre-requisites.
"foam2med" utility is compatible with OpenFOAM version 1.4.1 or higher.
Note, that OpenFOAM is required only in the run time to launch 
the first step of translation - conversion OpenFOAM data to VTK; 
it is not required for the building of the foam2med.

Before start to use "foam2med" it is necessary to source the generated "bashrc" file

Run "foam2med" utility for some already calculated solver cases, like the following:

    foam2med.py \
          --case-dir=${WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR}/run/tutorials/icoFoam/cavity \
          --foam-time=0.3 \
          --output-med-file=${WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR}/run/tutorials/icoFoam/cavity/cavity.med  \
          --output-mesh-name=foo

Use foam2med utility on the previously calculated OpenFOAM cases to generate
MED files. Please use --help command line option to get more details about
the supported feautres.
